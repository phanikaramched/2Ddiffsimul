# 2Ddiffsimul
This code simulates 2D diffraction (Debye-Scherrer) rings from user input.

This code requires the use of the MTEX toolbox (https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/)

The standard input for this code is a set of .rpt files from an Abaqus CP-FEM simulation. The code can be easily adapted to read user-defined crystal orientations (as Euler Angles or a Rotation Matrix) and elastic strain applied and simulates the diffraction spots on a 2D area detector.
